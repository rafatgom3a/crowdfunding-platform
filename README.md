# Crowdfunding Web Application

## Overview

Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising small amounts of money from a large number of people, typically via the Internet. It is a form of crowdsourcing and alternative finance. In 2015, over US\$34 billion was raised worldwide by crowdfunding ([source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdfunding)).

This project aims to create a **Crowdfunding Web Platform** specifically targeting users in **Egypt**. The platform allows users to create fundraising campaigns, donate to projects, comment, and interact with the community.
